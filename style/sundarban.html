    <br>
<p>The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, shared by Bangladesh and India. It is a place where land meets water in a magical way—filled with winding rivers, tidal creeks, and dense green forests.<br>
What makes Sundarbans truly beautiful is its raw, untouched nature. The forest is home to the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger, spotted deer, crocodiles, wild boars, and hundreds of rare birds and fishes. As you float through its narrow waterways in a boat, you’ll see sunlight filtering through the leaves, hear the calls of exotic birds, and feel the peace of a land that remains wild and free.</p>
<p>The name "Sundarban" means <b><i><span class="x1">beautiful forest</span></i></b>, and it lives up to that name in every way—with its mysterious beauty, natural silence, and rich biodiversity.</p><br>
<p>In one line,“The Sundarbans is nature’s hidden kingdom—wild, beautiful, and deeply alive.”</p>
